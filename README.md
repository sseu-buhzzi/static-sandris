# Sandris (俄羅斯沙塊/沙俄方塊)

**Sandris** is a static web-based simulation inspired by Tetris, where blocks disintegrate into individual units upon contact and fall like sand.

This project explores a physics-like behavior in a grid-based system, replacing rigid stacking with granular flow.

## Features

- Non-traditional Tetris behavior: blocks fall apart on impact
- No scoring or line-clearing mechanics
- Pure front-end implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Fully static: no server or build tools required
